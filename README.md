This is a brand new project that I'm working on. As such, your [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFqQjaMXazjGPQmPA9YcCmO9KGwco-Oh0Oi0RbFQMfHotJhg/viewform?usp=sf_link) is appreciated. Your answers are not collected or stored anywhere.

There is no penalty for guessing or getting questions wrong here. This is purely a resource for you to practice. Questions here do not necessarily reflect the type of questions that you will see on exams, but highlight important concepts to understand. 

Feedback ideas:

* Site apearance
* Answers you thought should be marked as correct
* Types of questions that would be helpful
* Questions you'd like to submit for others to also practice
* Anything you'd like to share
